    <h1>Introduction to Mitochondria</h1>
    <img src="images/mitochondria-icon.jpeg" alt="A Detailed Graphic Representation of a Mitochondra Cell">
    <p>Popularly known as the “Powerhouse of the cell,” mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are a double membrane-bound organelle found in most <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/eukaryotic-cells/">eukaryotic organisms</a>. They are found inside the cytoplasm and essentially function as the cell’s “digestive system.”</p>
    <p>They play a major role in breaking down nutrients and generating energy-rich molecules for the cell. Many of the biochemical reactions involved in cellular respiration take place within the mitochondria. The term ‘mitochondrion’ is derived from the Greek words</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>“mitos” and</li>
      <li>“chondrion”</li>
      </ul>
        
    <p>which means</p>
        
      <ul>
      <li>“thread” and</li>
      <li>“granules-like”</li>
      </ul>
        
    <p>respectively. It was first described by a German pathologist named Richard Altmann in the year 1890.</p>
